    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The website is needed so people can book reservations to participate in our white water rafting services ahead of time.
      It will allow us to be able to schedule more trips and plan ahead for scheduling employees and raft maintenance. It will also help us have more consistent revenue and a place to share all the information about our business people need to know. As well have a place we can fill our waivers online so they can be saved more easily.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>I would say young adults. People fromm 18 to 35. People at the age getting there first real world jobs and hopefully having some extra pocket change to spend on an adventure. They want something to do outside and fun with friends and rafting is the perfect fit. They alot of times don't have the equipment or knoweldge of how to host this activity so that is what we will be doing for them. My audience will most likely be using mobile and desktop. Plan to taylor this website by having lighter colors to make it seem new and young to connect with your target audience and I will also plan the wording of the site to connect with the youn adult audience and use images of young adults on white water rafting trips.</p>
